# Final-Project
My project is the game of hangman. One person inputs a word to guess, and the other person guesses letters in the terminal until they either guess the word or get too many incorrect guesses and lose. I used a method to clear the terminal that I found here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/32295974).
To run the project, download the HangMan.java and Display.java files and put them in a new java project. Then, run the Hangman.java file.


# Peer-Review

I was reviewing your final project for Computer Science.

I didn't put any comments or change any in your code since it worked very well. The structure of your program is clear, and I could understand what the code is doing at all times. I also like the way you make your program very object-oriented. Overall, I think you did a very good job.
